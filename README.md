<h1>Prop Paintings </h1>

KoloWn has been making works that cross and transcends back and forth between public spaces, traditional indoor spaces and in the digital realm. While most of the time the product of their process produces absurd and conflicting works,it also allows them to explore, invent and discover techniques and processes that are novel to them.
<br>
In their digital and web-based interactive works using digitized physical materials and use codes modify,enhance and in some ways destroy it. On the other hand they have been utilizing digital fabrication in transforming digital works to physical objects  for their indoor and outdoor installations.
<br>
Their last version of the web-based project Philippine Collagian (2019-present) allows the user to create a digital assemblage of digitized found wooden objects. After exhibiting for a group show last year, the outputs of Philippine Collagian were supposed to be transformed into a piece using digital fabrication techniques and digital printing. 
<br>
As the pandemic and lockdown happened and without access to fabrication labs and the materials and tools they were comfortable working with, KoloWn revisits traditional techniques in reconfiguring the wood. A portion of the wood were remnants from  past projects from 10 years ago, some of them were recent driftwoods gathered after a storm; a process what the Visayan locals called "managsa". 
<br>
Unlike digital works that can exist on servers for years as long as you pay, physical materials are subjected to physical laws such as decay. It is in this problem that koloWn experimented and in some ways found a process how to intervene into the material. Using epoxy resin to laminate the front surface and marine epoxy to reinforce the rotten back surfaces gives the object a new life while maintaining the grit and rawness .
<br>
The process of image-making and material intervention in this series is parallel to their process in their public intervention. While in public intervention, the physical space gives a prompt and idea what to add, in this series of objects the existing formal qualities of the material is the prompt, it is what gives them hints and cues what images to add and what meanings to be revealed.
<br>
As KoloWn's process of never-ending iteration of transcendence into another dimension,these series are titled Prop_Paintings because they are a literal "prop" for their virtual installation called "Drawing Room". Created during the first few month of the pandemic, it is a web-based VR accessible via web browsers resembling a fantastical working space,giving the audience a virtual studio visits during lockdowns.
<br>
What's next?  Is it possible that KoloWn's "Drawing Room" would be materialized "In Real Life".?
